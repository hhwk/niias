Первый ответ:
 Ключевым в повышении эффективности портов является синергия между адаптацией транспортных потоков и оптимизацией инфраструктуры.

Второй ответ:
1. The importance of a systemic approach in enhancing the efficiency of ports under infrastructure and spatial constraints is highlighted in this work. An effective development of port hubs requires a synergy between the adaptation of transport flows and the optimization of infrastructure, based on three key principles:
- Differentiated cargo handling that minimizes time costs by prioritizing less labor-intensive cargo categories capable of ensuring seamless traffic flow.
- Integration of innovative technology for wagon inspection and distribution. Automation and remote monitoring help reduce operational downtimes and optimize the time spent on cargo verification.
- Flexible infrastructure adaptation taking into account local limitations. This principle aims to efficiently use limited spaces and create conditions for modernization without harming the urban environment.
  2. The focus should be shifted towards more efficient types of cargo such as fertilizers, vegetable oils, and grain. These commodities require less time for handling operations. For instance, fertilizers need less time for loading and unloading.
  3. A transition to more efficient cargo like fertilizers and grains would allow the Tuapse Sorting Station to increase its throughput capacity and reduce the time spent on cargo handling operations. This would contribute to a stable growth in freight transportation, improving environmental indicators, and reducing congestion on the port infrastructure, promoting sustainable regional development.
  4. To address the issue of insufficient rail yard space, it is recommended to lay down at least two additional tracks within the storage area. The implementation of these measures would increase the sorting station's handling capacity by 3% and 5%, respectively.
  5. It should be noted that coal remains one of the most time-consuming types of cargo handled at the Tuapse Sorting Station, causing delays in other cargo handling operations. A shift towards more efficient commodities such as fertilizers, vegetable oils, and grain would shorten cargo handling times, improving overall operational efficiency.
  6. In addition to these measures, it is crucial to adopt a long-term strategy that considers the potential for further expansion while adhering to environmental and social requirements of the region. This approach will create conditions for sustainable growth and development of the port hub.
